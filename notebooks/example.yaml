    description: We developed and applied a novel lentivirus-based massively parallel reporter assay (lentiMPRA) to directly compare the functional activities of 2,236 candidate liver enhancers and 204 controls in an episomal versus a chromosomally integrated context. By using integration-competent vs. integration-defective components of the lentiviral system, we directly compared the functional activities of 2,236 candidate liver enhancers in a chromosomally integrated versus an episomal context in the human liver hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, HepG2.
